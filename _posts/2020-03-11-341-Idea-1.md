## Best Idea 1  
#### Bird Scaring device for agriculture 
I have personal experance with this issue  
Drones have already been employed for bird scaring but I believe there is room for improvement. 
* Use of sirens 
* Use of materials to increase birds fear 
* Use of machine learning for bird tracking 
* Bird tracking with aggressive flight manoeuvres 
* Full automation of charging 
* Use of salt guns
