Concept 1 draws insperation in its form from command module of the saturn V Rocket. The shape of the window complements the form of the polished aluminum body, and allows the space dust to be observed. The brushed matte black aluminum base creates a grounded enclosure with the matte black drawing on the darkness of space. The textured matte red and blue cap piece allows for a tight seal with the body ensuring none of the hazdious space dust escapes.

Concept 2 draws from a sample collection tool used to gather the intial lunar samples. The mechanism of the geometric form have been stripped down to instill the essance of the tool, with only the sterile what jaws of the tool remaining. This feature is inspired by and instilled with the care and importance theses samples held as they were a very valuable resouce to the science community on earth, and provided great insights into many diffrent fields. The rough finish to the body of the enclosure represents the utality and necessary functionality of the enclosure.
