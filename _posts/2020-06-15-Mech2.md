Design 2 uses an Actuated mechanism to translate motion through the enclosure. Opening and closing the jaws. This simulates the original tool and motion that was used to collect moon samples but uses the interaction with the enclosure as the source of the motion.  This direction is inspired by the engineering and ingenuity it took to get these precious samples back to earth. And for this reason the mechanism are visible from the exterior. Explaining to the user how the motion is created.
