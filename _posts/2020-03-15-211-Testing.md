"Significant solutions tend to emerge when new production techniques are exploited as a means to a greater end; the crafting of objects that stands testament to the people rather than manufacturing or functional imperatives."    

**Basic design elements of:**  
* Form 
* Surface 
* Materials (materials and their visual quality will help to add specificity and depth to your interpretation)   
* Textures  
(these by definition implicate composition, proportion, balance, scale, colour, light and shadow, contrast,
transparency and reflectivity).**  

The 3D enclosure of the piece of moon dust from the Apollo 11 mission should explicitly convey through visual language: 
* The Identity (Social and cultural values) 
* Impart the meaning of the object 
* Express the design intent 
     
The enclosure **must not be Simplistic or Stereo-typical**  
  
**The majority of the design will be 3D printed but a small amount of additional material is allowed if it performs a specific function within your design.**
  
**PROCEDURE**
* Start by understanding the context and significance of the theme
* Start to consider the visual vocabulary that might be associated with or represent your chosen theme
* In-depth research into aspects of the theme will give you further insights, discover interesting facts or traits linked to the context
* These interesting traits will form the seeds of your design
* Develop a develop a scenario of use for your enclosure
* Define how and where that object will be used
* Embellish your design with a narrative, if that narrative enhances the identity and meaning of the object.
* Precedents that establish the significance of the context and visual the language associated with your theme
* Consider how the interesting aspects can be represented through visual language and materials 

Precedents definition: "an earlier event or action that is regarded as an example or guide to be considered in subsequent similar circumstances."
