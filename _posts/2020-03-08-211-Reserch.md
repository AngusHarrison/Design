The themes that interest me the most are: 
2. A piece of moon dust from The Apollo 11 mission 1969
6. A piece of thread from Alexander McQueen’s Plato's Atlantis collection 2010 


**2. A piece of moon dust from The Apollo 11 mission 1969,**  July 21 at 02:56 UTC  
The first successful landing of humans on the moon, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins   
2.15 hours on the surface, 21.36 hours on the moon.  
**Collected 21.5kg of lunar material.** 
**Site Name: Tranquillity Base     
Apollo Spaceship Name: Columbia**
“The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM)**(Call Sign Snowcone)** with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM)**(Call Sign Haystack)** that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.”  
3 days travel in the command model to reach the moons surface  
**"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."**  
 "Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: "before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.""

The Space race was fueled by the cold war, as the Russians launced Sputnik 1, proving their nuclear capabilitys
