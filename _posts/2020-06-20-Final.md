The developments to my design were largely pragmatic but also allowed me to develop my visual language further. The fins at the base were added to allow the enclosure to stand freely, something I had not initially considered. But were also patterned to highlight the symmetry of my design. They also draw their form from the stereotypical rocket. More simplistically conveying my theme.
The centre capsule was also added to provided a more definitive, hierarchical position for the contents and ensures the toxic contents does not escape. The palette paying homage to the American led mission.
